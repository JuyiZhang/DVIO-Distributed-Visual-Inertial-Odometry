# DVIO-Distributed-Visual-Inertial-Odometry


Distributed visual inertial system utilizes a block-chain-like approach to locate user without the need of IMU. The system is suitable for a multi-person scenario where one user can see another.

## Components
There are four main components, each run as a separate application. The corresponding environment and its function is defined below
